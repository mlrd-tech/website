# **10\. TERM AND TERMINATION**

## **10.1 Term**

These Terms commence on the date you first access or use the Product and continue until terminated as provided herein.

## **10.2 Termination by You**

You may terminate these Terms at any time by ceasing all use of the Software and closing your Account at https://mlrd.app. Inactivity by you or the Software does not constitute termination by you.

You remain responsible for all Fees incurred prior to termination, except when a valid “No-Risk Guarantee" claim applies in accordance with section 4.1.

## **10.3 Termination by mlrd.tech**

mlrd.tech may immediately and without prior notice terminate these Terms for cause if:

<ul>

(a) you materially breach any provision of these Terms; or

(b) you fail to pay any applicable Fees when due; or

(c) you cease to do business as a going concern; or

(d) mlrd.tech is required to do so by law.

</ul>

mlrd.tech may also terminate these Terms for convenience if:

<ul>

(i) your Account has no active paid License and no activity as measured and determined by us for more than thirty (30) days; or

(ii) we elect to discontinue the Product; or

(iii) we cease to do business as a going concern.

If terminated for convenience, we will provide at least thirty (30) days written notice; provided, however, that any such termination for convenience shall not take effect until the end of your then-current paid License term.

## **10.4 Effect of Termination**

Upon termination of these Terms:

<ul>

(a) your License to use the Product immediately terminates; and

(b) you must immediately cease all use of the Product and delete all copies of the Software in your possession or control; and

(c) you remain liable for all Fees and other obligations accrued prior to termination.

</ul>

Since your User Data remains on your systems, mlrd.tech does not possess your User Data and, therefore, has no obligation regarding its retention or deletion.

## **10.5 Survival**

The following sections shall survive termination: Sections 1, 3.4, 3.5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10.4, 10.5, 11, 12, and 13\.

## **11.2 Jurisdiction**

The parties irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Ontario with respect to any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with the Terms of Service. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to these Terms of Service and is hereby expressly excluded.

## **11.3 Damages, Remedies, and Relief**

You acknowledge that a material breach of these Terms, such as but not limited to a violation of your obligations under Sections 3, 5, and 6, may cause irreparable damage to mlrd.tech that cannot be fully remedied by monetary damages. Accordingly, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, mlrd.tech will be entitled, in addition to pursuing other remedies under these Terms or at law, to:

<ul>

(a) terminate these Terms and your License in accordance with Section 10.3; and

(b) seek injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.

</ul>

# **12\. GENERAL PROVISIONS**

## **12.2 Modifications**

mlrd.tech reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be posted to Related Domains with at least thirty (30) days notice before taking effect.

For existing customers with active paid License, material changes that adversely affect your rights will not take effect until your next license renewal date, at which point your continued use constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms. Changes relating to legal requirements, security, or abuse prevention may be effective immediately. If you do not agree to modified Terms, you may terminate your License before the renewal date in accordance with Section 10.2.

## **12.3 Waiver**

The failure of mlrd.tech to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of mlrd.tech.

## **12.4 Severability**

If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, or if such modification is not possible, severed from these Terms. The remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

## **12.5 Assignment**

You may not assign or transfer these Terms or any rights hereunder without the prior written consent of mlrd.tech. mlrd.tech may assign these Terms without restriction. Any attempted assignment in violation of this section shall be null and void.

mlrd.tech shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to act of God or government, natural disaster, accident, fire, flood, earthquake, war, terrorism, riot, embargo, pandemic, strike or labour action, network or cloud provider outage, shortage of transportation, facilities, fuel, energy, labor, or materials.

## **12.7 Independent Contractors**

The parties are independent contractors. Nothing in these Terms creates a partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, or employment relationship between the parties.

# **13\. THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS**

## **13.1 Imports and External Systems**

The Software includes third-party software components, libraries, or other materials ("Imports") that are subject to separate license terms. A list of Imports and their license terms is available in the Documentation.

The Software also communicates with third-party software products or services (“External Systems”) such as database servers and cloud vendor services. Using the Software may require compatible External Systems, but you are solely and completely responsible for all External Systems including costs, operations, and any applicable licenses.

## **13.2 Import License Terms**

Your use of Imports is subject to the applicable third-party license terms. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any Import license terms with respect to your use of the applicable Import, the Import license terms shall control solely with respect to that Import.

## **13.3 No Additional Warranties**

Imports are provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind. mlrd.tech makes no representations or warranties regarding Imports and shall have no liability arising from your use of any Imports.

External Systems are not provided by mlrd.tech and, therefore, we make no representations or warranties regarding External Systems and shall have no liability arising from your use of any External Systems.

# **14\. TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS**

## **14.1 Beta Features**

mlrd.tech may make available Beta Features of the Product to users on a temporary basis for evaluation purposes. mlrd.tech does not make any commitment to provide Beta Features in any future versions of the Product. mlrd.tech may immediately and without notice remove or modify any Beta Features for any reason without liability to users. All Beta Features are provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind.

## **14.2 Previous Versions**

mlrd.tech will support and maintain only the current major-minor version (“Series”) of the Software.

To prepare for a Required Upgrade, existing customers with active paid License will receive at least thirty (30) days prior notice.

## **14.3 Security Patches**

mlrd.tech will provide timely security patches for the current and penultimate Series of the Software. mlrd.tech may, at its sole discretion, also provide security patches for older Series. All security patches, regardless of Series, may permanently alter how the Software functions, including but not limited to removing features or functionality, or introducing breaking or backwards-incompatible changes.

## **14.4 Compatibility**

Compatibility with other systems, such as other databases or cloud vendor services, is published in the Documentation, and no other compatibility is supported or implied. mlrd.tech does not guarantee on-going or future compatibility with other products and services outside its control. In the rare event that another system on which a Series of the Software depends becomes unavailable or end-of-life (EOL), mlrd.tech may discontinue that Series and invoke a Required Upgrade.
